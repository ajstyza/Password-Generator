# Password Generator Starter Code
As a developer, I want to show employers that I'm able to combine 
multiple types of javascript logic: conditional statements, arrays,
for loops and query selectors to interact with the browser.

This project defines the values of various character arrays, concates them,
then using the information to randomly generate a unique password. Users
can decide which criteria they want their passwords to adhere to: upper/lowercase
letters, special symbols, and numbers.
